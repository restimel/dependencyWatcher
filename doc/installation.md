## Installation

If you want to install the application on your own computer or server (in order to manage your own site or to improve the project), you are at the right place.

This application needs a bunch of pre-requist components.

First of all, you need to get the code from Github

	git clone https://github.com/restimel/dependencyWatcher.git


To get started, youâ€™ll need node installed on your computer (https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki).

You can now run the application with the following command:

    node main.js

This will start a server on port 8000. If you want to change port you can use command -p. To know all available commands use --help.

Then you can connect with your browser to:

	http://localhost:8000/index.html

The parsing can be configured with configuration.json. To know more about configuration read [the configuration documentation](./configuration.md).

## Contribution

If you want to contribute.
First, thank you!

You'll need the code locally. So you can follow the steps described in the [installation section](#Installation).

All codes related to back-end (parsing and web-server) are stored in modules directory.
All codes related to front-end (displaying graph) are stored in pages directory.
